# After connecting to influx CLI you can use the following commands...

# Create database
> CREATE DATABASE time_test
> USE time_test

# You don't actually have to create tables in InfluxDB.  Since it is geared towards time series (and only time series),
# you insert information to a "series" and, similar to Graphite/Statsd it just creates new "series" (buckets) when one
# doesn't exist (similar to upsert). Cool!!!
