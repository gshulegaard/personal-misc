  The left button moves you back to your previous window   while the right button moves you forward to a new window.

- The ACTION BAR is located at the bottom of the screen and behaves like a footer.

- The ACTION BAR contains a variety of buttons for performing specific actions from your current window.

- Many actions are enabled or disabled based on the properties of your currently selected object.

- The Event List is the BASE WINDOW for ATMS Mobile version 5.1.

- Training events that are available for grading may be selected from the list.

- The ACTION BAR contains buttons for performing specific tasks for your
  currently selected training event.

- The DETAILS button takes you to the EVENT DETAILS window.  You can view
  summary information about the training event from this window.

- The right button in the NAVIGATION BAR takes you to the EVENT TRAINEES
  window.

- Trainees assigned to the training event will be listed here with their primary
  phone and e-mail address.

- From the EVENT TRAINEES window you can use the forward navigation button to
  return to the EVENT LIST.

  view electronic documents that have been attached to the training event.

- You may additionally open attachments for viewing using the "OPEN" ACTION
  BUTTON.

- The REVIEW button takes you to the CURRENT TRAINING REVIEW window.

- This window shows you the training history of a specific trainee for the
  curriculum the training event belongs to.

- If there are multiple trainees in the selected event, you can select a
  different trainee using the "Trainee" button.

- You may view comments left by other instructors for specific training events.

- You may also view other completed training curriculum using the "History"
  ACTION BUTTON.

- As an example, we select a Line Check event with an experienced trainee.

- Since this trainee has completed several other training courses, we can select
  a different course using the "Curriculum" button.

- The TRAINING HISTORY window is similar to the CURRENT TRAINING REVIEW window,
  but allows you to view the training records of the trainee from a different
  course.

- Returning to the EVENT LIST window, the ROSTER button takes you to the
  training event's ROSTER window.

- This window allows you to alter the event's roster by: removing a trainee,
  adding a trainee who has already been queued for the training, or adding a new
  trainee who has not yet been queued for the training event.

- Selecting the "Add Trainee" button will show a list of trainees queued for the
  training.  To add one, select the desired trainee.

- Selecting the "Add New" button will show an unfiltered list of qualified
  trainees who have not been queued for the training.

- You may also search for a specific trainee by their last name and/or employee
  number. To add, select the desired trainee.

- The UNGRADE and UNLOCK buttons are only available for specific event statuses.

- To UNGRADE an event, select an event that has a status of "In Grading" and hit
  the UNGRADE button.

- This will take you a ROSTER window where you can select the trainees you wish
  to ungrade.

- Ungrading an event will remove any current grading information and return the
  training event to a "Ready" status.

- If an event has begun being graded by another instructor, you will first have
  to use the UNLOCK button to be allowed to UNGRADE the event.

- When unlocking a training event, a message block will prompt you and contain
  the name of the instructor who was previously in grading.

- After unlocking, you will be able to ungrade the event normally.

- If you have a printer configured for your mobile device, the PRINT button will
  print the grading form for the selected event.

- Before printing, you are able to review the grade sheets from the PRINT
  GRADING FORM window.

- Finally, from the EVENT LIST window, you may grade events with the GRADE
  button.

- Grading in ATMS Mobile is the same grading process as in ATMS itself and is
  covered in the ATMS User's Guide.

  training event for offline grading.

  its status to "Download".

- The DOWNLOADED EVENT LIST window will show all training events currently
  stored on the device.

- You may GRADE or REMOVE an event.  Additionally, completely graded events will
  allow their grading information to be UPLOADED back to ATMS.

- Events ready for uploading are indicated by an "UPLOAD" status.

- To upload an event, select an appropriate event and hit UPLOAD.

- This will remove the event from the DOWNLOADED EVENT LIST and save the grading
  information on the ATMS server, changing the event's status to "Complete" as
  we can see here.
