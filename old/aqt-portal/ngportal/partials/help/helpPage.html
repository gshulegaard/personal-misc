          <p>
            A helpful side-menu will appear on the left side of your browser
            window with your desired printed resource in it.

          <p>
            Simply click "Download" for your desired resource and you will be able to

      <p>
        It is important to note that in order to support remote printing, 
        <abbr title="Advanced Training Management System">ATMS</abbr> converts
        all printable documents into .pdf files before sending them to the
        client.

      <h1 id="uploading-files" style="padding-top: 40px; margin-top: 0;">Uploading Files</h1>

      <p>
        The portal
        supports uploading files into 
        <abbr title="Advanced Training Management System">ATMS</abbr> directly
        from the browser.  There are two ways to upload files.
      </p>

      <h3>Click and Drag:</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Click and drag a file onto the browser window that has your
            <abbr title="Advanced Training Management System">ATMS</abbr> client
            running.
          </p>

          <img src="/assets/help/uploading-drag.png"
               class="img-rounded img-responsive">
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            A helpful side-menu will appear on the left side of your browser
            window showing the upload progress for the file you are uploading.

               class="img-rounded img-responsive">
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Once the upload is finished, the file will be placed in a drive named
            "A on ATMS RDP" that is made available to 
            <abbr title="Advanced Training Management System">ATMS</abbr>.
          </p>

          <img src="/assets/help/uploading-fs.png"

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Now you will be able to attach the uploaded file into
            <abbr title="Advanced Training Management System">ATMS</abbr> where
            applicable.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, you will be able to select the file in "Attachment
            Maintenance".
          </p>

      <p>
        This <abbr title="Advanced Training Management System">ATMS</abbr> web
        client also supports the downloading of files.  In most situations it is
        preferable to use the printing mechanism, however, downloading
        <em>is</em> supported.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the drive "A on ATMS RDP" there is a "Download" folder:
      </p>

      <img src="/assets/help/uploading-fs.png"
           class="img-rounded img-responsive">

      <p>
        Any file saved in this folder will be automatically downloaded to your
        web browser.
      </p>

      <h3>Example:</h3>

      <p>
        You can use the "Save As..." <abbr title="Right Mouse Button">RMB</abbr>
        menu option to save a file from

      </ol>

      <h1 id="touch-screens" style="padding-top: 40px; margin-top: 0;">Touch Screens</h1>

      <p>
        The <abbr title="Advanced Training Management System">ATMS</abbr> web
        RDP solution has robust touch screen support including click-and-drag
        and right-click commands.  This guide describes how to use these
        commands from a touch-enabled device.
      </p>

      <h3>Touch to click</h3>

      <p>
        By default, the 
        <abbr title="Advanced Training Management System">ATMS</abbr> web portal
        uses "touch-to-click" commands from touch-enabled devices.  This means
        that you may simply touch anywhere to simulate a "click" wherever your
        finger is located.
      </p>

      <p>
        This also means that double-tapping simulates a double-click.
      </p>

      <h3>Right click (<abbr title="Right Mouse Button">RMB</abbr>)</h3>

      <p>
        To perform a right-click (<abbr title="Right Mouse Button">RMB</abbr>),
        touch and hold the position on the screen you wish to perform the
        right-click.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, within 
        <abbr title="Advanced Training Management System">ATMS</abbr> a 
        <abbr title="Right Mouse Button">RMB</abbr> opens a menu with actions
        for the specific window you are on:
      </p>

      <img src="/assets/help/print-option.png"
           class="img-rounded img-responsive">

      <h3>Double tap (and HOLD) to drag</h3>

      <p>
        In order to drag the mouse in a clicked mode, like dragging a scroll bar
        or moving a window, simply double-tap and hold.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just like for double-clicking, double-tap, but instead of lifting your
        finger on the second tap, hold it down for a moment and you will be able
        to drag your mouse in a clicked mode.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, double tapping and holding a scroll bar will allow you to
        slide it up and down, scrolling through a window's contents as if you
        were clicking and dragging with a mouse.
      </p>

      <h1 id="change-password" style="padding-top: 40px; margin-top: 0;">Change Password</h1>

      <p>
        You can access the "Change Password" form by clicking on the "Settings"
        icon in menu in the upper-right corner of the browswer window.
      </p>

      <img src="/assets/help/settings-icon.png"
           class="img-rounded img-responsive">

      <p>
        This will open a modal dialog with a simple form in it:
      </p>
      
      <img src="/assets/help/change-password.png"
           class="img-rounded img-responsive">

      <p>
        Simply enter your new desired password twice and click "Submit".  The
        "Submit" button will be disabled until you fill out both fields.  If you
        do not enter the same password in both fields, an error message will
        be displayed.
      </p>

      <p>
        If successful, a success message will display.  You will be able to
        start using your new password immediately (on next login).
      </p>

      <h1 id="forgot-password" style="padding-top: 40px; margin-top: 0;">Forgot Password</h1>
      
      <p>
        In addition to changing passwords, this web application supports the
        recovery of forgotten passwords.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can find the "Forgot Password" button on the login screen:
      </p>

      <img src="/assets/help/forgot-password.png"
           class="img-rounded img-responsive">

      <p>
        This button will not be available until you enter a username.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you click on "Forgot Password", 
        <abbr title="Advanced Training Management System">ATMS</abbr> will
        attempt to send a password recovery e-mail to the specified user.  In
        order for an e-mail to be sent, you have to:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Enter a valid user account.
        </li>

        <li>
          Configure your user account with an associated e-mail address.  If
          your user account doesn't have an e-mail address defined, 
          <abbr title="Advanced Training Management System">ATMS</abbr> will not
          know where to send the recovery e-mail and you will not be able to sue
          the password recovery feature.
        </li>
      </ol>
